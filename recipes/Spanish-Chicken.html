            <p><li>Add green onions and bell pepper to drippings in pan; saute 2 minutes. Add kale and chicken stock; cover and cook 2 minutes or until kale is lightly wilted. Stir rice, vinegar, and remaining 1 teaspoon smoked paprika into kale mixture. Nestle chicken on top of rice mixture. Bake at 400 degrees F until a thermometer inserted into thickest part of a thigh registers 165 degrees F, about 22 minutes.</li></p>
